# Code Generation & Modification

## Following Instructions
* **Follow Explicit Instructions:** Only implement changes that were explicitly requested. Do not introduce unrelated features, refactors, or modifications.
* **Preserve Existing Code:** Carefully preserve unrelated code, comments, and functionality. Maintain the existing file structure and logic unless the requested change necessitates modification.

## Change Presentation
* **Single Chunk Edits Per File:** Provide all edits for a *single file* within one unified code block (diff). Do not provide multi-step instructions or explanations *for the same file* that require multiple applications.
* **File-by-File Changes:** Apply changes one file at a time to allow for easier review and error spotting between steps.

## Avoiding Unwanted Changes
* **No Whitespace-Only Changes:** Do not suggest changes *solely* consisting of whitespace modifications unless specifically requested. Format code according to established project standards if available.
* **No Implementation Checks:** Do not ask the user to verify implementations if the relevant code is already visible in the provided context. Assume the user can see the code.
* **Apply Changes Only When Needed:** Only suggest modifications or updates to files if actual changes are required based on the request. Don't suggest "updating" a file if no changes are necessary
