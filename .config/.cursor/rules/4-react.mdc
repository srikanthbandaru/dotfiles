# React Best Practices

* **Functional Components & Hooks:** Prefer functional components with Hooks. Follow Rules of Hooks. Extract logic to custom hooks.
* **Component Structure:** Keep components small, focused, composable. Define prop types clearly (TypeScript interfaces).
* **State Management:** Use `useState` (local), `useReducer` (complex local), Context API (sparingly for shared state). Keep state localized. Consider libraries (Zustand, Jotai, TanStack Query) for complex needs.
* **Performance:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` appropriately. Use proper `key` props. Use `React.lazy` / `Suspense` for code splitting. Profile when needed.
* **Forms:** Use controlled components. Implement client/server validation (e.g., with Zod). Handle loading/error/success states. Ensure accessibility.
* **Error Handling:** Use Error Boundaries. Handle async errors gracefully.
* **Accessibility (A11y):** Use semantic HTML. Implement ARIA correctly. Ensure keyboard navigation/focus management. Provide alt text.
* **Code Organization:** Group related files. Use clear naming. Co-locate styles or keep nearby
